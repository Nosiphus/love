			<p><b>Suicide</b></p>
			<p>
				You are loved. I can guarantee you that there is at least one person who cares very deeply about you. I can guarantee there is another as well. And another. And another.<br><br>
				
				If you are experiencing pain, whether physical or emotional, and you feel so helpless that suicide seems to be the only way out, just remember you can always turn to a friend, a parent, a teacher, a principal, or another adult. There are professional counseling services available to help you deal with the pain.<br><br>
				
				The federal government established the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to help you. You can call them at 1-800-273-8255.<br><br>
				
				If you have a story about how you survived an attempt or were able to stay strong throughout a highly depressing period, please contact us. If you're willing to make it public, we'll place it. We believe it's important for people to realize that others have gone through similar situations and got through it to see another day.
